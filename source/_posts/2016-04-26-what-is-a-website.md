Everyday millions of people access the internet to look up information, access accounts, and go on social media. Browsing on various websites. But what is a website and how does it work? Simply put, a website is a collection of files. And then the browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox etc.) interprets and lays out the collection of files. If you had a website and were keeping all the files on your computer and then opening the files with your browser of choice, the website would shut down every time you closed your laptop. So in order to make sure websites are accessible 24/7, we put websites on a different computer. Websites are put on the computers of a web host (BlueHost, HostGator, MediaTemple etc.), and refer to the web host as servers. In order to access a website, you must retrieve the IP address from the Domain Name System (DNS). How does this work? First, you must enter the domain name (the actual name of the website i.e. Facebook) into the web browser, which then makes a request to DNS to retrieve the IP address for the website. We do not see the IP Address because the IP address is linked to the website link. The IP Address connects with the internet provider then tries to connect to one of the files of the website, specifically the index file, and from there, if a connection is made, the content will be loaded. The protocol used to access DNS is called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). 
There are two main different types of websites. Some websites, like Facebook, vary in content depending on the user. Other websites, like a restaurant or corporate website, do not vary in content depending on the user. Facebook is a dynamic website while the other is called a static website. A dynamic website uses server technologies to achieve a website where the content changes and varies depending on the user. 
Most websites use some form of security and encryption to protect the data being accessed on the site. Most use Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) which is an add on layer of security to HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  HTTPS is normally used in transactions. HTTPS has Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) in it which protects these transactions. SSL helps prevent someone coming in between the transaction, securing the link between the user and the host. For example, when using Amazon, SSL will be used to secure the transaction between the buyer and seller reducing the chance of a hacker coming inbetween and accessing important information. There are other security frameworks that handle user input to help secure the website as well (XSS, SQLi, etc.). 
Overall, a website is a collection of files and a website can either be static or dynamic. Many websites have security built in order to reduce hackers being able to access information being transacted.
