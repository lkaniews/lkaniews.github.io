Choose Your Own: Dynamic vs. Static Web Page

Web Application vs. Static Web Page
	
A static web page, is a web page with a fixed content. The content will not change unless manipulated manually. It is not recommended to use a static website when the data will be updated regularly. Static websites are usually easier to build and modify. Static websites tend to be cheaper and are used by smaller companies who cannot afford to have a dynamic web application. While static web pages are quick and cheap some of the downsides that come are that a static website requires someone with experience to update the site, the site is not always as useful and the content will not be updated unless someone goes in and updates it (1) . An example of a static web page would be a corporate website or a restaurant website where multiple people could pull up the same page and the computer screens would be identical. 

Simply, a web application is defined as “an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface(2).”  A browser user interface is a way to interact with an application that is hosted on a remote device using the controls on a web browser. Dynamic websites are developed from web applications. On a dynamic website the content changes depending on the time, who accesses it (the viewer) and other factors (3). Advantages to a dynamic web site are that a dynamic site tends to be more functional, easier to update, allows for collaboration, and viewers will keep coming back to the site as the content changes. But, there are some disadvantages to a dynamic site including that a dynamic site is more expensive to develop and more expensive to host. An example of dynamic web site application is Facebook. On Facebook, the content the viewer sees depends on who the viewer is what time of day it is. If everyone opened Facebook at the same time, the computer screens would not be identical. 

Overall, a static web page has a fixed content while on a dynamic web application, the content will be ‘interactive.’
