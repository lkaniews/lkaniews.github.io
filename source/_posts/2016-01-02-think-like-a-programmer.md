	Throughout the past month in Computer Science, I have learned that programming a program, no matter how simple or complex, is more than likely something that will take more than one try. In fact, it might take more than 10 tries. Programmers must not be afraid to take on challenges and not give up if the program does not work right away. 

	Think about it, Alan Turing created the machine to crack ‘Enigma’ in 1940. Here we are now, in 2016, with new models of computers coming out every year. The creation of the computer, was a huge task that has taken over 70 years to perfect. Not to mention, many people before Alan Turing had the idea and/or plans to execute the creation of the computer.  All of these inventors, worked tirelessly and did not give up on an idea on an invention, while a large one, has taken decades to perfect. Alan Turing, Charles Babbage and many others all embraced the mindset of a programmer. 

	But what is the mindset of a programmer? 

	Programmers should have a “growth mindset” as opposed to a “fixed mindset”.  A “growth mindset...thrives on challenge and sees failure… as a heartening springboard for growth.” In turn, a programmer that embodies the “growth mindset,” grows as a result of failure, takes criticism and turns it into a positive, and embraces challenges head on while the “fixed mindset” is the opposite; not embracing challenges head among other aspects. Programmers should try to think in the “growth mindset” as it will only benefit oneself and one’s success in programming. Sometimes, embracing this mindset can be hard, but the long term effects of embracing it are far more valuable. A programmer should always be thinking positively and see the glass “half - full.” By practicing positive thinking, a programmer will approach solving a problem “in a more positive and productive way ” than if a programmer unhappily approached solving a problem.
	 Overall, programmers should not be afraid to make mistakes and realize that there is nothing wrong with failure, as it will only help us grow and learn.
