An if statement, according to Computer Hope is a “programming conditional statement that, if proved true, performs a function or displays information.” If statements can be applied to any programming language. But, what is a programming conditional statement? A conditional statement is a statement where one variable leads to another in a statement. For example if x then y. y relies on x happening in order for it to happen. Another example is if I clean my room, then I get a cookie. Putting it in computer programming terms, if a is greater than b, then puts “Cool.” A case statement is a variation of an If statement. The difference is that a case statement is used when there are multiple ‘ifs’ required in a row.  In a case statement the ‘ifs’ all relate to each other in the sense that they are all under the same topic. For example if we were to make a list titled weather, in that list would be the types of weather (sunny, rainy, snowy etc.). Now if we had to make that into programming a case statement would be used to deal with the manipulation. A case statement uses a jump table rather than conditionals like the if statement does. A jump table is a way to transfer programming control. 
It is said that If statements are faster than case statements.  Both of them are used as conditionals. They both function very similarly. Yet they are different in some way. The difference is small. In a case/switch statement the code could go many different ways based on the result of one variable. So, one variable is involved, in a sense, and it is easier for the reader to identify what it is. Compared to an if statement where it may be harder to identify where and what the one variable is.  So depending on the programming language, the case statements will be faster and more efficient. Case statements and if statements will generally produce the same thing.
